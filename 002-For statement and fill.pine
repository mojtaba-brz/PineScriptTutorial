//@version=5
// This script uses a for loop to calculate a moving average and plots it along with upper and lower limit lines

// The "indicator" function sets the title and display settings of the script
indicator("Using for statement", overlay = true)

// Inputs allow users to change settings from the settings panel of the script
price_type = input(close, "Choose price type") // User can choose the price type (close, open, high, low)
length = input(10, "Choose length") // User can choose the length for the moving average

// Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the prices
sum_of_prices = 0.

// A for loop that adds up the chosen price type over the chosen length
for i=0 to length-1
    sum_of_prices := sum_of_prices + price_type[i]

// Calculate the moving average by dividing the sum of prices by the length
moving_average = sum_of_prices/length

// Plot the moving average
plot(moving_average)

// Plot the highest high and lowest low over the past 20 bars as upper and lower limit lines
upper_limit_line = plot(ta.highest(high, 20), color = color.red, linewidth = 4)
lower_limit_line = plot(ta.lowest(low, 20), color = color.green, linewidth = 4)

// Fill the area between the upper and lower limit lines with different colors depending on whether the close price is above or below the moving average
fill(upper_limit_line, lower_limit_line, color = close > moving_average? color.rgb(133, 175, 134) : color.rgb(184, 126, 194))

// Suggested modifications:
// 1. Try changing the length and see how it affects the moving average
// 2. Try using a different price type for the moving average calculation
// 3. Try adding more indicators, like volume or RSI, and see how they correlate with the moving average
