//@version=5
// This script generates alerts based on the condition that the opening price is less than the closing price

// The "indicator" function sets the title and display settings of the script
indicator("Alert", overlay = true) // Note: Alerts only work when the alert is activated manually

// Define the condition for the alert
price_rise_condition = open < close

// Create an alert condition with a custom message
alertcondition(price_rise_condition, title = "Price Rise Alert", message = "The price is going up!") // This creates an inline alert condition with a custom message

// If the condition is met, trigger an alert with a custom message
if(price_rise_condition)
    alert("The price is going up!", alert.freq_once_per_bar) // This triggers an alert with a custom message

// Suggested modifications:
// 1. Try changing the condition for the alert and see how it affects the alerts
// 2. Try using different messages for the alerts
// 3. Try adding more conditions for different alerts
