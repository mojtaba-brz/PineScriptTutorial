//@version=5
// This strategy uses the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and Engulfing candlestick pattern to generate buy and sell signals

// The "strategy" function sets the title, display settings, and initial capital of the strategy
strategy("My strategy", overlay=true, initial_capital = 100000)

// Inputs allow users to change settings from the settings panel of the script
rsi_length = input(14, "Choose RSI Length") // User can choose the length for the RSI calculation
rsi_source = input(close, "Choose RSI Source") // User can choose the source (close, open, high, low) for the RSI calculation

// Define the conditions for bullish and bearish engulfing candles
bullish_engulfing_candle = close[1] < open[1] and close > high[1] and close > high[2]
bearish_engulfing_candle = close[1] > open[1] and close < low[1] and close < low[2]

// Calculate the RSI line
rsi_line = ta.rsi(rsi_source, rsi_length)

// Define the conditions for buy and sell signals
buy_signal = bullish_engulfing_candle and (rsi_line < 30 or rsi_line[1] < 30)
sell_signal = bearish_engulfing_candle and (rsi_line > 70 or rsi_line[1] > 70)

// Calculate the highest and lowest prices over the past 20 bars
highest_20 = ta.highest(20)
lowest_20 = ta.lowest(20)

// If the buy signal condition is met, enter a long position
if buy_signal
    strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long, qty = 10000)
    // Exit the position when the price reaches the highest price of the past 20 bars or falls 0.5% below the lowest price of the past 20 bars
    strategy.exit("Buy", limit = highest_20, stop = lowest_20*0.995)

// If the sell signal condition is met, enter a short position
if sell_signal
    strategy.entry("Sell", strategy.short, qty = 10000)
    // Exit the position when the price reaches the lowest price of the past 20 bars or rises 0.5% above the highest price of the past 20 bars
    strategy.exit("Sell", limit = lowest_20, stop = highest_20*1.005)

// Suggested modifications:
// 1. Try changing the conditions for the buy and sell signals and see how it affects the strategy
// 2. Try using different lengths for the RSI calculation
// 3. Try adding more indicators, like MACD or Stochastic, and see how they correlate with the signals
