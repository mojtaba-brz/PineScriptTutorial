//@version=5
// This script uses the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and Engulfing candlestick pattern to generate buy and sell signals

// The "indicator" function sets the title and display settings of the script
indicator("RSI + Engulfing", overlay = true)

// Inputs allow users to change settings from the settings panel of the script
rsi_length = input(14, "Choose RSI Length") // User can choose the length for the RSI calculation
rsi_source = input(close, "Choose RSI Source") // User can choose the source (close, open, high, low) for the RSI calculation

// Define the conditions for bullish and bearish engulfing candles
bullish_engulfing_candle = close[1] < open[1] and close > high[1]
bearish_engulfing_candle = close[1] > open[1] and close < low[1]

// Calculate the RSI line
rsi_line = ta.rsi(rsi_source, rsi_length)

// Define the conditions for buy and sell signals
buy_signal = bullish_engulfing_candle and (rsi_line < 30 or rsi_line[1] < 30)
sell_signal = bearish_engulfing_candle and (rsi_line > 70 or rsi_line[1] > 70)

// Plot the buy and sell signals on the chart
plotshape(buy_signal, "Buy Signal", shape.triangleup, location.belowbar, color.green,  size = size.small)
plotshape(sell_signal, "Sell Signal", shape.triangledown, location.abovebar, color.red, size = size.small)

// Suggested modifications:
// 1. Try changing the RSI length and see how it affects the signals
// 2. Try using a different source for the RSI calculation
// 3. Try adding more indicators, like MACD or Stochastic, and see how they correlate with the signals
