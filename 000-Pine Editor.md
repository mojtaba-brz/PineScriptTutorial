Next to the Editor, youâ€™ll find a Strategy Tester. This is a handy tool for checking the results of the strategies youâ€™ve written.

For reference, thereâ€™s a sample strategy provided in section 7. Additionally, if you navigate to open>New Strategy, youâ€™ll find another example. 

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Ž
