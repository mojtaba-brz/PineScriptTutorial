// This script changes the background color based on the current time

// The "indicator" function sets the title and display settings of the script
indicator("TimeStamp", overlay = true)

// Define the start and end times for the period of interest
start_time = timestamp(2022, 1, 1) // Start time is set to January 1, 2022
end_time = timestamp(2023, 1, 1) // End time is set to January 1, 2023

// Check if the current time is within the period of interest
time_within_period = time < end_time and time > start_time

// Change the background color to dark blue if the current time is within the period of interest
bgcolor(time_within_period? color.rgb(0,0,40):na)

// Suggested modifications:
// 1. Try changing the start and end times and see how it affects the background color
// 2. Try using a different color for the background
// 3. Try adding more conditions for different background colors
